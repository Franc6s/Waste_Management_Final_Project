# Selected topic
- Waste Management (as it relates to population and budgeting)

# Reason they selected the topic
- We decided to go with Waste Management because we were curious as to why certain areas have a different number of days for trash/recycling pickup. Is this due to population? Budget? 

# Description of the source of data
- [Fairfax County Data](https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/budget/sites/budget/files/assets/documents/fy2021/adopted/volume2/solid-waste-overview.pdf)
- [Arlington County Budget (2016- 2018)](https://budget.arlingtonva.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/06/21.-FY18A-Environmental-Services.pdf)
- [Arlington County Budget (2016- 2018)](https://arlingtonva.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/02/FY-21-Proposed-All-in-one-02242020.pdf)

Population Data
https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html (this has an API key)

Environmental and natural resources department spending by state

# Questions they hope to answer with the data
As population increases, what’s the determining factor to increase/decrease/re-evaluate trash is picked up?
- Number of trash pick ups

Impact of population growth to trash (in pounds) 
- If it gets to a certain point, there are environmental concerns

Is this due to population in the specific areas? 
Budget in the state/county? 
Staff availability?
Space at the dump to breakdown trash?

## Models that can be used
RBM – unsupervised learning, monitor a system, building a binary recommendation system, or working with a specific set of data
- Monitor population to gauge frequency of trash pickup
- Will help predict trash by population

Arima – time series model, categorizes moving averages and auto-regression
- Predict how much garbage is going to be generated, could be accurate for the next 4-5 years
- Moving average – if it hits a certain point, this would be the impact of trash 

Linear Regression

Classification model 
- Will assist in making a recommendation.
